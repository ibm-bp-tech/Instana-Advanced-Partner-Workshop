We will be creating an issue type event, which triggers when something out of the ordinary occurs. In this case, it triggers when a component of our application is offline. At the end of this lab, you will be able to verify that your event has triggered and review the event.\n\n## Step 1: \n\nClick Settings. \n\nThen click Events. \n\nLastly, click New Events. \n\n![Lab 9](images/lab9.1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nConfigure your Event with the following name: \n\n```\nMySQL is Offline -<your last name> \n```\n\nEnter Description of the Event to:  \n\n```\nMySQL has been offline for 1 minute  \n```\n\n## Step 3: \nConfigure the settings the following way: \n\nSet the Issue Severity to Critical. \n\nSet the Grace Period to 5s. \n\nSet Condition Source to System Rules. \n\nFor System Rules, select: Hosts that do not have matching entities on them. \n\nFor Entity Type drop down, select MySQL DB. \n\nChange the Entity Label Operator to Contains. \n\nEnter MySQL in the Entity Label field. \n\nSelect 1 min in the Offline for drop down. \n\nSelect your Application Perspective for the Scope. \n\n![Lab 9](images/9.2.png)\n\nStep 4: \n\nStop the MySQL Container on your host. \n\nSSH into your host. \n\nExecute the following command: \n\n```\nsudo docker stop robot-shop_mysql_1 \n```\n\n## Step 5: \n\nVerify that your Event has triggered. \n\nSelect Issues. \n\nReview Event. \n\n![Lab 9](images/lab9.3.png)\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6a8e7d70958c5d1746cc3b18c3fbd352","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":227},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab9"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab9\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 9 - Custom Events <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab you will create a custom event.
