At the end of this lab, you will be able to see the new endpoint name you have created on the dashboard.\n\n## Step 1:\n\nUsing the Instana UI, bring up the dashboard for your new rs-ratings-(your last name)service.\n\nThen, Navigate to the Endpoints tab.\n\nClick on the Configure Endpoints link.\n\n![Lab 8](images/lab8.1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nClick on the Add Custom HTTP Rule link.\n\n![Lab 8](images/lab8.2.png)\n\n## Step 3:\n\nEnter the following in the Custom HTTP Rule field:\n\n```\n/api/fetch/{sku}\n```\n\nFeel free to use the Rule tester (copy an actual call from the data to the tester to verify the rule is working correctly).\n\nThen, select save.\n\n![Lab 8](images/lab8.3.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nSelect Add.\n\n![Lab 8](images/lab8.4.png)\n\nAnd then verify that you see the new endpoint on the dashboard.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"99a67f471f2c88d83010901fc9b14e8a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1525},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab8"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab8\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 8 - Endpoint Mapping <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nEndpoints define the API of a service and provide a fine-grained view into what operations are exposed by the services.
