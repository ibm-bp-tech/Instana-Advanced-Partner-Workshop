The Instana Dynamic Focus search functionality can be used to filter the 3D maps, comparison tables, and incident views. The search bar has extensive abilities to search using fuzzy and wildcard searches as well as boolean operators. \n\n## Step 1:\nNavigate to the Infrastructure screen in the UI.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/lab5.1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nUse the following DFQs: \n\n```\nentity.host.name:<your_host_name> \n```\n\n```\nentity.host.name:<your_host_name> entity.type:host \n```\n\n```\nentity.host.name:<your_host_name> entity.selfType:host \n```\n\n```\nentity.zone:\"Partner Training\" \n```\n\n```\nentity.tag:Student=<your_last_name> \n```\n\n```\nentity.tag:\"Application=Robot Shop\"\n```\n\n```\nentity.tag:Student=<your_last_name> entity.type:jvm \n```\n\n## Step 3:\n\nClick on the \"Partner Training\" zone and then click on the host inside the zone as shown below:\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon1.png)\n\nClick on the \"Open Dashboard\" button to view the hosts dashboard.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon2.png)\n\nYou will see dashboard similar to below but the metrics might be different for your host.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon3.png)\n\nYou can view the details of the hosts in the left hand under side, under system details which includes Operating system, CPU, Memory, hostname, FQDN and so on.\n\nAlso, look for the custom tags assigned to this host and automatically discovered Technology stack on the host through sensors.\n\nOn the right hand side, you can see various host metrics like CPU usage, Memory usage and CPU load and how it has changed over time.\n\nYou can also look at the Filesystems attached to the hosts and Network interfaces and related metrics as shown below:\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon4.png)\n\nFurther down, you can also see TCP activity over time, key processes and their performance metrics, and you can also manage the agent running on this host by clicking on the Open agent Management.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon5.png)\n\nScroll to the top of the dashboard and click on the Stack button from the context guide. Here you can view the Infrastructure this host is running on and the processes running on this host under Infrastructure tab.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon6.png)\n\nYou can also review the applications tab for the applications/services running on this host.\n\nClick on Upstream/Downstream button to review the services calls to and from the host processes and their metrics.\n\n![Lab 5](../Labs/images/inframon7.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this lab we learnt about Dynamic Focus query format and infrastructure monitoring.
