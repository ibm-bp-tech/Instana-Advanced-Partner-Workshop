The host agent runs on your hosts to collect and aggregate data from various sensors before it sends the data to the Instana backend.  In this lab you will be installing a host agent on your assigned Linux Ubuntu virtual machine.   In the second part of this lab you will be verifying your virtual machine is seen by the Instana sandbox environment and visible in the Infrastructure map view.  You will also use the Dynamic Focus Query(DFQ) to filter on for your specific machine.\n\n## Step 1: \n\nAll Students should have received an e-mail inviting them to join the Instana partner tenant. \n\nClick Join Instana.\n\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.1.png)\n\nYou will have access to both the Demo and Sandbox Instana. \n\nFor the Labs we will be accessing the Sandbox instance. \n\nLaunch the Sandbox Instana Portal from the browser: https://sandbox-partner.instana.io \n\nYour screen will look like this: \n\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.2.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nClick on the three dots \"More\" from the sidebar.\n\nThen select Agents.\n\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.3.png)\n\nOnce you are on the Agents screen, select Install Agents.\n\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.4.png)\n\n## Step 3:\n\nYou will see a list of supported technologies in a table of icons. \n\nSelect Linux Automatic Installation (one-liner) from the list.\n\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.5.png)\n\n\nLeave the options at their default settings, and select the \"Install and start as a service\" option.\n\nWhen you are ready, hit the Copy button to copy the one-liner to your clipboard.\n![Lab 1](../Labs/images/lab1.5.1.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nSSH into the training host that has been provided as “ubuntu” (your instructor will provide a host IP address and password).\n\n```\nssh ubuntu@<IP address>\n```\n\nPaste the CURL statement that you copied in the last step into your terminal window and hit enter. \nYou should see a screen that will look similar to the one below.
